Can I Fly It?
=========

The idea of this application is for the site admins to provide a list of ship fits and associated required skills that users can then compare their EVE Characters 'Character Sheet' via the EVE API.

The system should present the users with a list of which fits they have the required skills to fly, and a skill list for those that they can't yet fly.

The system should also let the admins restrict fits or the display of required skills for fits to users or groups of users.
